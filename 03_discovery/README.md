# Mostly a music player

- Up and Down change the current track
- A and B change the master clock speed
- Left and Right change the overall tranposing (for compact tracks anyway)
- Select resets the current track
- Start pauses and resumes playback. Careful: if a note is designed to never finish, it will keep playing.
